1) Project Title : DATA ACQUISITION AND WRANGLING, SKEWNESS AND CORRELATION

2) Project Description : In this project, data has been acquired from 3 different datasets and then merged and concatenated after using different methods of     wrangling.
   
3) Prerequisites : PANDAS (A high level manipulation tool),
                NUMPY (For working with multidimensional arrays),
                SEABORN (For making a HEATMAP in order to show CORRELATION)
   
4) Installation : All necessary libraries have been installed.
   
5) Usage: Different methods have been used like: Merge datasets,
                                                Concatenate datasets,
                                                Identify unique values,
                                                Drop unnecessary columns,
                                                Dimension of the dataset,
                                                Datatype of the dataset,
                                                Datatype summary,
                                                Missing values.
